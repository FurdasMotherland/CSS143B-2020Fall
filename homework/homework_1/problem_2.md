## (45pt) Bubble Sort

Implement bubble sort for an integer array. 

You can decide whether the sorting will be in ascending or descending order. Add a comment to state your choice.

Write as many tests as you think necessary to demonstrate your bubble sort code works correctly. 

Bubble sort will be also discussed in class. If you need help understanding it, [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/) is a good start. 

When the homework is done, your code should pass all the tests that come from the assignment and those your added.
