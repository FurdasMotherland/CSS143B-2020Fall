## Dawn of The Fall

### Dates

    - Assigned: 09/30/2020
    - Due: 10/09/2020 Thursday 11:59pm

## Goals ##

- Java programming basics
- Write your own tests
- Get comfortable with the grading process

### Submission Instruction

- Create a pull request from your forked repository toward teacher's repo that yours forked from.
- Add both teacher and grader as reviewers.
- DO NOT make new code commits after submission deadline. Violation will be treated as late homework.
- Once grading is done, teacher will mark the PR as "approved" and grade will be published to Canvas

### Problems To Solve

There are **THREE** problems to solve. Please find the description of the first 2 problem in their own page:

- [Problem 1](problem_1.md) (45pt)
- [Problem 2](problem_2.md) (45pt)

- Problem 3 has 10 point as following: Send me a private message in Discord. Describe the following:
  - Your full name
  - Your technical background. For example, What programming language do you know? Have you used Java before? If yes, on what kind of projects? 
  - How much do you know about data structures such as array, list, tree, graph?
  - What do you like about programming?
  - What do you struggle the most learning about programming?
  - Feeling of the class so far and suggestions. Is it too fast? too slow? My accent is hard to understand? Need more explanation on topics?
### Code Correctness ###

Your code is as correct as what your tests show. Your code will be assumed to be not correct unless proven otherwise by your tests. No tests, no point. 

### Seed Code ###

[github repo for problem 1 and 2](https://github.com/pdgetrf/CSS143B-2020Fall-homework1)

### Notes ###

- Start early. Be active. Ask questions.
- Partial credits will be given. If you cannot finish some part, add comments describing your thinking.
- OK to search web for help. Give credits in your code if you use any. 
- Homework is to be done by yourself. Okay to discuss with others. 
- Late submission without explanation AND permission will receive **ZERO** point.  
- Read grader and teacher's code review comments. Be open to accept them for improvement but be prepared to defend your choice. 

### Code of Conduct

Plagarism will not be tolerated and will receive **ZERO** point, this includes (but not limited to)

- Copy others' code line by line.
- Use  online resources line by line, with or without credits.

Offense will be reported to the department.
