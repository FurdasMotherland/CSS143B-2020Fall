## How to Clone This Repo To Your Machine

On the [class repo page](https://github.com/pdgetrf/CSS143B-2020Fall), click the green "Clone or download" button. You can either git clone the repo or download a zip file. Here is an example on linux/mac:

```console
pdu:~$ git clone https://github.com/pdgetrf/CSS143B-2020Fall.git
```

And there's a [tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) on how to clone a github repo on **ALL PLATFORMS**. We will use git a lot in this course.
